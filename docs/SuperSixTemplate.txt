SUPER SIX TEMPLATE

Date: Day-Of-Week Month Day, Year

1) List the top 6 things you want to accomplish today
2) Sometimes if a task is a little bit big, I will break it down
	- Into smaller subtasks
	- I delete these things as I complete them
	- Deleting a task I've completed gives me a bit of a thrill
3) I save this file on my desktop in the center of the screen
4) That way it jumps out at me
	- If I ever think about what I should be doing
	- I check my SuperSix.txt file
5) At the end of the day, I update the Day/Month to tomorrow
6) Then I move the uncompleted tasks up to the top
	- I then fill in the empty spots with more tasks
	- On occassion I'll put in an easy task just to mark it off fast!
	

Other:
This area lists small things I need to do that aren't big enough for a Super Six
Could be something like, "Deposit a check at the bank" or "send a bank wire"
This is also reminders for me to do certain things (call XXXXX back before 5pm)

Upcoming:

In this area I will write down things I know will eventually become a Super Six. This way I can grab them when the time comes. I also list ideas here for projects that may someday turn into a Super Six item.

Training:
Here I list any courses or programs I want to go through or am in the process of going through
I often include the link and login info so I have it.
